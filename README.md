# GPT-2 Model Implementation

This repository contains a detailed step-by-step implementation of the GPT-2 model, exploring its architecture and how it powers state-of-the-art language generation. By coding the GPT-2 model from scratch, we uncover the inner workings of its key components, including transformer blocks, attention mechanisms, and feed-forward networks. This guide demonstrates why the GPT-2 architecture excels at generating coherent and contextually rich text.

Whether youâ€™re familiar with neural networks or new to transformers, this guide provides a hands-on perspective on building and fine-tuning the GPT-2 model.

## Overview

The GPT-2 model is broken down into its main components, and we implement each block in a clear and structured manner. This breakdown allows for a deeper understanding of how the model processes text and generates predictions.

### GPT-2 Model Breakdown:

- **Token Embedding**: Encodes input tokens into continuous vectors.
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds positional information to the token embeddings.
- **Transformer Blocks**:
  - **Multi-Head Attention**: Captures relationships between tokens in the input sequence.
  - **Layer Normalization**: Ensures stability and consistent input scaling.
  - **Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN)**: Adds complexity and captures deeper patterns in the data.
  - **Residual Connections**: Helps the model learn efficiently by passing information between layers.
- **Output Layer**: Maps the hidden states to vocabulary size for token prediction.
